# Machine-Learning-Review

Review of machine learning related ideas.

----

## ðŸ”¥Machine-Learning-AndrewNG-2012

Includes all finished MATLAB homeworks of Andrew NG's [Machining Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course)(_old_2012_version_) on coursera. Registration for this course is closed on June 14, 2022.

Unlike many existing solutions which include `.m` file only, this code repo is done with MATLAB `.mlx` notebook files, which are the same as the latest version available on the course website.

## ðŸ¤—Machine-Learning-AndrewNG-2022

The [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. 

This folder includes all programming JUPYTER homeworks from the three subcourses:

- Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
